# Crazy Eights Rules

Crazy Eights is a 2-6 player shedding card game where the objective of the game is to **be the first player to discard all of your cards.**

Each player is dealt 5 cards (7 for two players), and play proceeds clockwise.

In each turn, players must discard cards which suit or rank matches the top card of the discard pile.

**Eights(8)** are wild cards and they can be played on top of any card. When played, the player must declare a suit. The next player must play a card matching the declared suit, or play another eight.

If you can't play any cards or choose not to do so, you must draw from the draw stack up to a maximum of three cards (configurable in room settings, gear icon on the bottom right) until you can play a card. If you have reached the maximum draw limit and unable to play, you must pass.

## Special cards

You may choose to play the game with **special cards**. Each of the special cards can be changed, enabled or disabled through the room settings. The following section assumes the default special cards.

- **2 (Draw Two)** - When played, the next player must draw two cards and pass their turn, unless if they counter with another 2, which in this case the effect "stacks" and the next player must then draw 4 cards and so on.
- **Q (Skip)** - When played, the next player loses their turn.
- **A (Reverse)** - When played, the play direction reverses (i.e. clockwise to anti-clockwise and vice-versa). This has no effect on 2 player games.

If at the start of the game, the first card flipped over is a special card, then the effect applies to the first player. If the first card flipped over is an eight, then the first player is free to play any cards on their first turn.
